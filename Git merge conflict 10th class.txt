Git merge conflict 
******************


A merge conflict happens in Git when two branches have competing changes to the same part of a file, and Git canâ€™t decide which change to keep.

ðŸ’¥ When Does a Merge Conflict Occur?

1. You try to merge two branches where the same lines in a file were changed.

2. Git can't auto-merge and asks for manual resolution




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. firstly add some data in the git hub repository in a file  (f2)

2. secondly  in local system also add some data in the same file  (f2)

	$ git add f2

	$ git commit -m "conflict"

	$ git push origin main ---> after doing this you will get the message like rejected 

	$ git pull --> this command ables to show the (main|merging)

		This show the both data of git hub and local system after this
 
	$ vi f2 --> make the final changes

	$ git add f2
	
	$ git commit -m "merging" ----> here we can see only (main) 

	$ git push origin main --->sends to the git hub
