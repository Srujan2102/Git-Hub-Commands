Branching 
*********

Git branching allows you to work on multiple versions of your codebase at the same time — safely and efficiently. It’s one of the core features that makes Git so powerful for collaboration and experimentation.

When you create a new branch, you’re creating a new pointer that can move independently from the main branch.
Different environment codes using branches



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From main branch we will create a feature branch with in it 


dev ----- uat(user acceptance testing) - sit(system integration testing) -- preprod ---> continuous delivery
dev --- uat -sit --prod ----> continuous deployment(used by the client)


1. code promotions
2. Microservices in docker 
3. Regions of code (Dev, Uat, sit, preprod, prod)


*code promotions*
*****************

How do you push your code to GitHub

 A feature branch is created by the separate team there are going to give the feature branch details we will pull the feature branch and then we will make changes
and we are going to raise a pull request 

merging is done by different teams





Fistly we have to create a new branch in the GitHub then 
	
	git pull  ----- it pulls the changes
	
	git branch -----used to see the list of branches and to see the current branch
	 * main

	git checkout branchname ------ used to change the branch

	* ----- denotes the current branch

After this make changes in the file by using vi editor

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deleting commands
*****************	

	git branch -d branchname -------- used to delete the branch with out any modification (like not merging with the main branch) just we have created

	git branch -D branchname ----- used to delete the branch in local system

	git push origin --delete branchname ----- used to delete the branch in github

	To delete the branch firstly we have to move to the main branch then only we can delete the feature branch

	We do not delete branches or tags in the real time
