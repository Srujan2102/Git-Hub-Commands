 Source code management (scm)

1. DVCS ----Distributed version control system (GitHub )
	you can get the working copy of the github source code to our local system.

2. CVCS ----Centralized version control system  (subversion)
	you cannot get the working copy of the code to our local system but you can do the changes by directly connecting to the server.

stages for git hub 

workingdirectory--->staging area----> commitstage----> Gitrepository (remote repository)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

we have to make changes in WD like ----creating file (touch f1)

then we have to send to SA  ----git add filename(f1)

staging to commit ---- git commit -m "commitmessage"


------------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly we have to config username and email 

WD TO SA ---- git add . 
SA TO CS ---- git commit -m "commitmessage"
CS TO REMOTE REPOSITORY ---- git push origin main 


git log ------ used to check the history of the commits

config is stored in commit stage 

* whether it is in WD OR SA  we use ------ git status


1. If we add a new file in working directory and then use -----git status ( It shows the message untracked files )

2. If we remove the file ---rm filename ( It shows it is deleted )

3. If we change anything in the file ( It shows the file is modified )
